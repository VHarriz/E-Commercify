# E-Commercify

## Description 
This is the E-commerce backend. I was able to seed the data and connect the routes by using the notes from the starter code and the course work. Due to time constraints i was not able to get all my routes connected. My category routes do seem to be functioning properly.

## Troubleshooting
Because I did not commit and push until i got near the end of this project, I had to deal with a heap of problems and errors at the end. It took a long time and a lot of reading. Then once I thought it would work, another error and another. Will not do that moving forward.
